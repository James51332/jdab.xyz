				<p>In fall of 2019, I started to learn C++. How? Through a large project in a 
        field I had no experience in. Needless to say, I was in over my head. I started
        by watching the <a href="https://hazelengine.com">Hazel Engine</a> tutorial series
        made by TheCherno. It is actually a pretty great resource, but most of my code
        was a line by line copy of what he wrote. Even though I enjoyed following along
				with someone else, I eventually realized I needed to learn C++ if I wanted my
				game engine to be any good. </p>
