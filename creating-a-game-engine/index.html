      <h1 class="heading">Creating a game engine...</h1>

	    <p>In fall of 2019, I started to learn C++. How? Through a large project in a 
        field I had no experience in. Needless to say, I was in over my head. I started
        by watching the <a href="https://hazelengine.com">Hazel Engine</a> tutorial series
        made by <a href="https://thecherno.com">TheCherno</a>. It is actually a pretty great resource, 
        but most of my code was a line by line copy of what he wrote. Even though I 
        enjoyed following along with someone else, I eventually realized I needed to 
        learn C++ if I wanted my game engine to be actually any good. </p>

      <h2 class="heading">The Failures</h2>

      <p>My first attempt at a game engine was named Timid. Most of these early engines are lost,
        but rest assured, it was a rebranding of <a href="https://hazelengine.com">Hazel Engine</a>.
        I was so new to C++ that I couldn't figure out how to compile my code on macOS. Since I
        didn't have a Windows 10 PC, I installed a virtual machine on my laptop to use Visual Studio.
        I got about as far as opening a window using <a href="https://www.glfw.org">GLFW</a> before I abandoned that project for my next project.
      </p><p>
        While there were many copies of Timid made, almost identical in the codebase, The next significant project I worked on was
        called Outlaw Engine. This project didn't make it as far, only successfully implementing a logging library, but it built
        using Xcode. This was actually a huge milestone because it meant I was beginning to understand the vast world
        of C++ and how it worked; I began to learn more about compilers and linkers and the general C++ ecosystem.
      </p><p>
        Next on the list is <a href="https://github.com/James51332/NeptuneGL">NeptuneGL</a> and Neptune. The idea I had here was that I would create a library for platform specific API
        calls (<a href="https://github.com/James51332/NeptuneGL">NeptuneGL</a>), and one for everything else (Neptune). Surpisingly, <a href="https://github.com/James51332/NeptuneGL">NeptuneGL</a> is actually a rather nice repository. It was heavily
        based off of <a href="https://www.glfw.org">GLFW</a> but when I wrote the code I understood what I was doing. Neptune is where this project
        falls apart. This project taught me why it's important to plan ahead when I work on a large project. I designed the system with an XNA/Monogame
        style but I kept changing the API. I still didn't have a great understanding of the features of a game engines at this point so I didn't
        really know what to expect.
      </p><p>
        The final failure is <a href="https://github.com/James51332/Apollo">Apollo</a>. I had accept defeat and cloned Hazel Engine again,
        just trying to grasp design concepts. I was still too lazy at this point to read a paper or learn about game engine architecture.
        I wasn't proud of it, and I didn't learn much, so it's another failure
      </p>
